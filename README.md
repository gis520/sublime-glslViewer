Sublime Text 2 plugin for live-coding GLSL Shaders using glslViewer ( MACOS X and Linux only).

## Installation
1. Install [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer). By default it will be installed on ```/usr/local/bin``` if that's not the case edit it the ```glslViewer.sublime-settings``` file once you finish this steps.
2. Clone this repository on you ```Packages``` Folder. For example:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/
git clone 
```

## Usage

Every time you open a ```.frag``` or ```.fs``` file it will render it through ```glslViewer``` which will reload the shader every time you save it ;)
